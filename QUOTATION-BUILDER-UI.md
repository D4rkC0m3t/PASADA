# Quotation Builder - UI Reference

Due to file size, the complete Quotation Builder implementation will be built incrementally.

## Current Status
✅ Imports added
✅ Interfaces defined  
✅ State management implemented
✅ Helper functions created
⏳ UI needs to be built

## Implementation Plan
The UI will include:
1. Project selection dropdown
2. Client information display
3. Line items table with add/remove
4. Material selector modal
5. Calculations panel
6. Form fields for title, tax, discount, etc.
7. Save button

## Next Step
Replace the placeholder "Coming Soon" content (lines 247-348) with the full form UI.
